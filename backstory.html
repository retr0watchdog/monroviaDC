        <h2>What's Being Proposed</h2>
        <p>A massive industrial data center is planned for construction on the border between Monrovia and Mooresville, Indiana. This facility would be one of the largest in the region, consuming enormous amounts of water and electricity while generating significant noise and air pollution.</p>
        
        <p>The proposed facility would operate 24/7, requiring constant cooling systems that would draw millions of gallons of water daily from our local water supply. The industrial-scale generators and cooling equipment would create continuous noise pollution affecting nearby residential areas.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Environmental Risks</h2>
        <h3>Water Consumption</h3>
        <p>Data centers require massive amounts of water for cooling systems. The proposed facility could consume up to 5 million gallons per day, putting strain on our local water infrastructure and potentially affecting water availability for residents and local businesses.</p>
        
        <h3>Air Quality Concerns</h3>
        <p>The facility would require multiple backup diesel generators that would emit pollutants during testing and emergency operations. Additionally, the increased truck traffic for maintenance and deliveries would contribute to air quality degradation in our community.</p>
        
        <h3>Noise Pollution</h3>
        <p>Industrial cooling systems and generators operate continuously, creating a constant low-frequency hum that can be heard for miles. This noise pollution would significantly impact the quality of life for nearby residents.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Community Impact</h2>
        <h3>Property Values</h3>
        <p>Studies show that industrial developments like data centers typically reduce nearby residential property values by 10-20%. The visual impact, noise, and environmental concerns make homes less desirable to potential buyers.</p>
        
        <h3>Infrastructure Strain</h3>
        <p>The massive electrical demands of the data center would strain our local power grid, potentially leading to higher utility costs for residents. The increased heavy truck traffic would also accelerate wear on our local roads.</p>
        
        <h3>Limited Economic Benefits</h3>
        <p>While proponents claim economic benefits, data centers provide very few permanent jobs relative to their size and impact. Most positions require specialized technical skills not readily available in our community.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Why We Can Win</h2>
        <p>Our community has the power to stop this development through organized action and civic engagement. Here's how we're fighting back:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Petition Drive:</strong> We're collecting signatures to demonstrate community opposition</li>
          <li><strong>Town Hall Meetings:</strong> Regular community meetings to organize and inform residents</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Action:</strong> Working with environmental lawyers to challenge permits and approvals</li>
          <li><strong>Political Pressure:</strong> Engaging with local officials and elected representatives</li>
          <li><strong>Media Campaign:</strong> Raising awareness through local and regional media</li>
          <li><strong>Statewide Coalition:</strong> Partnering with <a href="https://www.citact.org/" target="_blank">Citizens Action Coalition</a> and other organizations fighting data center expansion across Indiana</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We're not alone in this fight. The <strong>Citizens Action Coalition</strong>, Indiana's oldest consumer and environmental advocacy organization, is leading a statewide campaign against the unprecedented data center build-out that threatens Hoosier communities. Their expertise and resources strengthen our local efforts.</p>
        
        <p>Together, we can protect our community's water, air, and quality of life. Every signature, every voice, and every dollar donated brings us closer to victory.</p>
